# Welkin-Claimer ![AppleScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppleScript-Scripting-blue)

The Welkin-Claimer is an AppleScript program designed to automate the process of opening the Genshin Impact app, performing a series of click actions, and then quitting the app. 

## How it works

1. The script first opens the Genshin Impact app.
2. It waits for a specified delay (default is 30 seconds).
3. It performs a left click at a specified location.
4. It repeats the delay and click two more times.
5. Finally, it quits the Genshin Impact app.

## Customizable Delay

The delay between each click is customizable. By default, it's set to 30 seconds, but you can easily adjust this to fit your preferences. Simply update the delay value in the script to the number of seconds you prefer.

## Pre-requisites

Before using this script, please ensure that Genshin Impact is installed on your Mac using PlayCover. The script will of course not do anything if the game isn't installed.
